# Authorizer

* WordPress Plugin: [https://wordpress.org/plugins/authorizer/][wp]
* Changelog: [https://github.com/figureone/authorizer/blob/master/readme.txt][changelog]

*Authorizer* is a WordPress plugin that restricts access to specific users, typically students enrolled in a university course. It maintains a list of approved users that you can edit to determine who has access. It also replaces the default WordPress login/authorization system with one relying on an external server, such as Google, CAS, or LDAP. Finally, *Authorizer* lets you limit invalid login attempts to prevent bots from compromising your users' accounts.

*Authorizer* requires the following:

* **CAS server** or **LDAP server** (plugin needs the URL)
* PHP extentions: php5-mcrypt, php5-ldap, php5-curl

*Authorizer* provides the following options:

* **Authentication**: WordPress accounts; Google accounts; CAS accounts; LDAP accounts
* **Login Access**: All authenticated users (all local and all external can log in); Only specific users (all local and approved external users can log in)
* **View Access**: Everyone (open access); Only logged in users
* **Limit Login Attempts**: Progressively increase the amount of time required between invalid login attempts.
